# PersonalWebsite

This is the fifth version of my website, designed during the hottest days of July 2023, eight 
years after the previous revision, dated July 2015.

Ok, I agree, this is clearly too much time for a web engineering professor to update his website.
In the meanwhile, many things have changed... for example, I moved all the didactic web pages and 
material to specific [GitHub](https://github.com/gdellapenna) *organizations*, so this website is 
now online mainly as a reference for my research activity.

Therefore, to build a modern, easy to update website, without any security concerns, I opted for 
a static website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with a simple, wide and mobile-friendly 
design created from scratch using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and some free images taken 
from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com).

Obviously, the design is [fluid and responsive](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), 
as every modern website should be. Scripts (all based on [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)) are used to 
enhance the user experience, but the pages are still fully usable also with javascript disabled. 

The website is synced and puplished on the DISIM People web server: <https://people.disim.univaq.it/dellapenna>
